# Distrosetup

## Why?

I'm jumping back and forth between the distros and to ease the pain
of setting up everything constantly decided to finally make some scripts
to help with that.

## Focus

Main focus will be on arch distros using pacman but in the future, I'm
planning to expand it to support other distros/package managers.

## Other deps

Will depend on my [dotfiles](https://github.com/athrail/dotfiles) repo for
dotfiles and keep them separate for the time being
